This repository started its way as a fork of ddollar/git-utils. Some of the utilities here are from there, others are my own 
creation, some loosely based on ddollar's versions.

git-addremove     - Adds added files, removes deleted files
git-last          - Simple alias; shows the last few commits (defaults to 1, accepts a number for different number of commits)
git-tree          - Shows a graph of the repository's commits, branches and merges

git-incoming      - Shows incoming changes (this doesn't contact the server, so it's recommended to use git fetch first)
git-outgoing      - Shows outgoing changes (which would be pushed to a remote server with git push)
git-rstatus       - Shows complete status as compared to the origin (or other specified remote branch)
git-sync          - Performs a pull, merge/rebase, then a push. Can stash unsaved changes and pop afterwords
